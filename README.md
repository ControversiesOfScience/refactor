## Immediate Goals

- How much can I reduce load time, compared to the older version?
  Eliminate unused code
  Minify Javascript
  Asynchronous loading / other http2 optimizations
- How much can I reduce the total number of assets?
- Can I completely eliminate the inactive loading state?
- Set up a modern workflow
  Experiment with npm scripts
- Refactor into ES6 / SCSS
- Improve code readability
  Break up into modules and classes
  Reconsider variable and function naming
- Explore the possibility of a more responsive approach
  Can impress.js run on a mobile device?
  Is there an intuitive UI for smaller devices which extends desktop approach?
- Can I eliminate hardcoded URL's?

## Notes

    "Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined"

Babel will transpile ES6 -> ES5, but it will not perform the module bundling for you ...

jQuery Kinetic produces errors if I simply drop the code into the directory, but works fine if I add it via npm.  Presuming it's a dependency issue, moving on.

Materialize.css: This package runs into serious issues when bundling.  I've attempted to create a Browserify shim to address them, but each time I resolve one dependency error, I get another ...

This shim does indeed seem to get past most of the more typical errors that I've seen with this issue, but it does not fully resolve them.  Since I'd like to get on to other aspects of the refactor, I'm going to go ahead and revert to pulling Materialize in via script tag.

That worked, with some minor stylistic implications related to the new SCSS workflow (Materialize is overriding my list item styles).  So, I've added my own overrides to deal with that.

Now, I'm going to refactor the SCSS to reduce redundancy.

Noticing a few problems which were not occurring before ... (1) Arrow keys are not consistently working, (2) sidenav background colors are not consistently changing, (3) there's a flash of content when the page loads, and (4) the zooms are not consistently working (may be skipping slides).  This turned out to be a really easy fix: I had two copies of impress.js in my workflow: one in /dist/js/ and the other in src/lib/js, which was getting bundled with the rest of my code.  Removing the copy in src/lib/js fixed the problem.

Now, I can finally get to refactoring into ES6 modules ...

Split up mobile and desktop into separate files.  Eliminated redundant checks for device type.  Placed utility functions into a separate static class.  Nothing has blown up yet.

Noticing that some of the mobile functionality has evaporated.  Will get to that soon.

I've broken the desktop version into modules.  The most challenging part is the Keyboard class.  Something is not quite wired up correctly post-refactor, because the zooms are glitchy.  But, the desktop version is now infinitely more readable than it was.

Debugging ...

A few of the variables needed to be globals, so I turned them into Keyboard object properties.  That now works.

Now noticing an issue with interactions with the sideNav list items; doesn't always take me to the correct slide, and posts URL as ...

    file:///Volumes/PRODUCTION/Database/code/worldviewer/refactor/index.html#undefined

Looks like I might want to contemplate a more general-purpose solution to these hashes.

Since January, I have adopted a standard template format for all of my controversy graphics, like here on the left:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/worldviewer/refactor/blob/master/top-spot.jpg" />
</p>

I call this a "controversy card".  The idea with these cards is that I can construct them with HTML and CSS: The title, summary and circular annotation can all be overlayed onto the graphic in order to generate a controversy card.  There is also markdown associated with each of these cards which I generate in parallel with the graphics.  The full collection, as it stands, can be seen here:

*Controversies of Science*

https://plus.google.com/collection/Yhn4Y

It's expected that at a later time a graphic designer might have their way with this template.  This permits me to continue to fill out the controversy API content until that time.  At the current moment -- December 16, 2016 -- I have created 170 of these controversy cards.  The hope is to double that over the next year, at which point I will completely switch over to creating the social network.

This approach of refusing to generate the conversation infrastructure until I have in place seed content is to ensure my own future ability to attract talent.  If people arrived and all they saw was this empty shell of a social network, there would be no precedent set for the type of content I expect there.  And the social network would predictably fail to gain adherents.  By seeding the social network with the best collection of scientific controversies and critiques of modern science in the world, I dramatically increase the chances of keeping visitors.

The point about this API is that my index.html is very bloated at the moment since there currently is no AP.  I've yet to figure out my hosting situation, so this is all client-side without any server-side templating.  I will be getting to the creation of this controversy API, but something that I can do in the near-term is to use Ajax calls to simulate the modularization of my HTML.  This could dramatically improve the HTML's readability, by separating the page's data from the structure.

Another thing I'd like to check on today is whether or not impress.js can be run on mobile devices.  When I looked into this a year ago, the answer appeared to be no.  I want to re-evaluate that situation now, as I've seen a suggestion that it may be possible here ...

https://github.com/impress/impress.js/wiki/Mobile-support

Based on the testing, it's become apparent that at least five things must happen in order to have a chance of supporting this code on a mobile device:

(1) The graphic must be far smaller.  It's currently at 21mb, but I've been size-limiting *all* of the graphics in my controversy collection to 10mb -- a slightly more reasonable value.

(2) I would have to ditch Materialize.css because it's not rendering properly on mobile and it's way too monolithic.  This would involve recreating the sideNav, toasts and icon styling -- probably a day's work (?).  If I was to do this, there would be the added benefit of dramatically reducing the complexity of my code and improving my bundling.  Also, I could eliminate my device-detection library, device.js, and probably elminate a number of node packages.

(3) It would make sense to refactor out of jQuery -- something which I'm eager to do regardless and soon.

(4) I may (?) have to rewrite some parts of impress.js in order to get this to work.  It's difficult to know if this can be made to work, since impress.js is by default turned off for iphones, so none of the online demos demo mobile behavior.

(5) I would have to create a new responsive design, and perhaps more directly handle touch interactions.

It probably makes sense to focus for now on desktop support, as I do know for a fact that the card-based approach I was going with for mobile is not a workable solution long-term.

Pruned the unused Node packages which I was using in my attempt to bundle Materialize.

I'm now going to experiment with setting up apigee-127's API dev environment, which includes the Swagger editor, the Swagger tools, Volos.js and Apache usergrid.  This is essentially an API construction suite which sits on top of a graph database, based upon Node.js.  This is in part just to get some more experience with Swagger, but it's especially nice that Swagger is open source.  I very much like the fact that this rests on Node, which gives me a non-blocking server.  And the fact that usergrid is a graph is really icing on the cake.  I'd even be interested in hosting my controversy API with apigee-127 if it's an option.

My interest is in seeing how quickly I can get this API up with some content on a hosted URL, so that I can pull the Impress data out of my HTML.

The video I'm watching is at ...

Build APIs in Node.js and Swagger 2.0 with Apigee-127

One of my concerns going into a service like apigee has to do with vendor lock-in, and specifically the possibility that the company might go out of business.  And something that helps to ameliorate that concern is the fact that apigee was just purchased by Google quite recently, mentioned here ...
