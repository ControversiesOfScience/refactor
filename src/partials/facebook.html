Facebook recommends 1200 x 630 pixels for the og:image dimensions (info), which
is an approximate aspect ratio of 1.91:1. This gives your shared post a full-size image
above the post text. According to Facebook, you can go as low as 600 x 315 and still
receive a full-size image, but I found that you can go as low as around 450 width. If
you go too small (about 400 in width or less), your post will only receive a small
square thumbnail on the left side. Also, if your image has a tall aspect ratio, Facebook
may display a tall aspect ratio thumbnail on the left side (not square).

A note on cropping: If you have a large image that is not in the 1.91:1 aspect ratio,
Facebook may center and crop it to fit. If you have a small image that is not square,
Facebook may crop it or shrink it to fit the small thumbnail size.

Reddit uses a 70 x 70 square image for its thumbnail. Images of all sizes are resized
down to this. Images that are wider than square will be shrunk down further to fit the
width, while images that are taller will be cropped. Having a wide image is not good as
it reduces the overall size of the thumbnail space that your image utilizes. Due to this,
going with the Facebook recommendation of 1200 x 630 is bad for Reddit sharing.

To work well on both Facebook and Reddit, be sure to make your og:image 1200 x 1200 (or
larger) that looks good both square and cropped. Facebook will crop the top and bottom,
while Reddit will keep it square. This gives you the largest thumbnail image on both
sharing platforms.

One last thing: If you do want to have the smaller square image thumbnail on Facebook, just
make sure your og:image is smaller than 400x400 and square in aspect ratio. -->
